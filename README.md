# Introduction

In this repository I store infrastructure files, Helm charts, K8s manifests, etc.
(This section will be improved)

## The k8s homelab

My homelab kubernetes cluster has one master node and three worker nodes.
It is used to test deployments, run microservices, and experiment with infrastructure configurations in a controlled environment.

## CI/CD organization

For the CI/CD implementation, I use Jenkins for pipeline automation and ArgoCD for continuous delivery.  
This setup allows me to maintain up-to-date environments and streamline deployment processes across multiple services.
